       <p><b>Q: What is Linerub?</b></p>
       <p>Linerub is a new and creative way to interact with friends. Nowadays users have complete control over their posts. At Linerub, we encourage collaboration: one user writes a post, other users tag that post with pictures. It's simple, interactive, and free.</p>
       <br>
       <p><b>Q: Who came up with the name "Linerub"?</b></p>
       <p>A: We did.</p>
       <br>
       <p><b>Q: How do I create a post?</b></p>
       <p>A: It’s simple! Expand the sidebar by clicking on the top-right button, and then click “Share a story”. You can create a post in 2 simple steps!</p>
       <br>
       <p><b>Q: When can I add pictures to my post?</b></p>
       <p>A: In Step 2 you select words in your story. These words become tags that can later be tagged with pictures by anyone that views your post, including you!</p>
       <br>
       <p><b>Q: How do I view pictures on other posts?</b></p>
       <p>A: Click on a post and the post box will expand. View pictures by clicking on highlighted words.</p>
       <br>
       <p><b>Q: How do I add pictures to other posts?</b></p>
       <p>A: After the post expands, click on the “add pics” button. Select any of the highlighted words and follow the instructions.</p>
       <br>
       <p><b>Q: Where can I view my published posts and drafts?</b></p>
       <p>A: Click on the “My stories” tab in the sidebar.</p>
       <br>
       <p><b>Q: What does the “Get random!” button do?</b></p>
       <p>A: Glad that you asked! By clicking on "Get random!”, you will get a random story from a random Lineruber! You can “like” the post and follow the user.</p>
       <br>
       <p><b>Q: Can I edit or delete my published posts?</b></p>
       <p>A: Of course you have the freedom to delete your own post! Unfortunately, you can only edit posts that haven't been tagged with images. These posts will be under "Saved Drafts".</p>
